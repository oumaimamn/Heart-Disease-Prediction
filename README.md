# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting heart disease using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various health indicators such as age, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure, the model determines the likelihood of a person developing heart disease.

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset used comes from [source name, e.g., UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease) or another public dataset.
- It contains features such as:
  - **Age** 🏥  
  - **Gender** 👤  
  - **Blood Pressure** 💉  
  - **Cholesterol Levels** 🩸  
  - **Heart Rate** ❤️  
  - And other medical parameters.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍  
- **Pandas, NumPy** for data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** for data visualization  
- **Scikit-Learn** for machine learning models  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for experimentation  
- **Streamlit**  for deployment  

## 📊 Machine Learning Models

- Random Forest
